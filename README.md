Project Overview
The Stake Mine Predictor uses a combination of modern machine learning techniques to analyze patterns in stake mining operations and predict potential risks or inefficiencies. This tool is designed to aid stakeholders in optimizing their strategies and minimizing losses.

Key Objectives:

Risk assessment of mining operations.
Performance improvement via predictive insights.
Adaptability to different datasets and scenarios.
Features
Automated Risk Detection: Predicts risks with high accuracy.
Customizable Parameters: Tailor the model to fit specific datasets or scenarios.
Visualization Tools: Insightful charts and graphs for easier decision-making.
Scalable Implementation: Suitable for individual miners to large-scale operations.
Installation
